## Description

NNI (Neural Network Intelligence) is a lightweight but powerful toolkit to help users automate Feature Engineering, Neural Architecture Search, Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Compression.

The tool manages automated machine learning (AutoML) experiments, dispatches and runs experiments' trial jobs generated by tuning algorithms to search the best neural architecture and/or hyper-parameters in different training environments like Local Machine, Remote Servers, OpenPAI, Kubeflow, FrameworkController on K8S (AKS etc.), DLWorkspace (aka. DLTS), AML (Azure Machine Learning) and other cloud options.
This package is vulnerable to Man in the Middle (MitM) attacks due to downloading resources over an insecure protocol.

Without a secure connection, it is possible for an attacker to intercept this connection and alter the packages received. In serious cases, this may even lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on your host server.
