## Description
Apache MXNet (incubating) for Deep Learning

Apache MXNet is a deep learning framework designed for both efficiency and flexibility. 
It allows you to mix symbolic and imperative programming to maximize efficiency and productivity. 
At its core, MXNet contains a dynamic dependency scheduler that automatically parallelizes both symbolic and imperative operations on the fly. 
A graph optimization layer on top of that makes symbolic execution fast and memory efficient. MXNet is portable and lightweight, 
scalable to many GPUs and machines.This package is vulnerable to ```MITM``` or Man-In-The-Middle attack due to a downloading resources through insecure protocols.
It is possible for an attacker to intercept and alter the packages which may leads to ```RCE``` other attacks which may help the attacker gain access to host
