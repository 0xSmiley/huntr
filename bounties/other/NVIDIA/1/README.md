## Description
NVIDIA Deep Learning Examples for Tensor Cores

This repository provides State-of-the-Art Deep Learning examples that are easy to train and deploy,
achieving the best reproducible accuracy and performance with NVIDIA CUDA-X software stack running on NVIDIA Volta, Turing and Ampere GPUs.
This package is vulnerable to ```MITM``` or ```Man-In-The-Middle``` attack due to a downloading resources through insecure protocols. It is possible
for an attacker to intercept and alter the packages which may leads to ```RCE``` other attacks which may help the attacker gain access to host.
