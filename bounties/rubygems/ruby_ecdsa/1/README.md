# Overview

`ecdsa` is a gem that implements the Ellipctic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) almost entirely in pure Ruby.

This package is vulnerable to Timing Attack, practical recovery of the long-term private key generated by the library is possible under certain conditions. Leakage of bit-length of a scalar during scalar multiplication is possible on an elliptic curve which might allow practical recovery of the long-term private key.
