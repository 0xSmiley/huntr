# Overview
Affected versions execute arbitrary commands remotely inside the victim's PC. The issue occurs because user input is formatted inside a `command` that will be executed without any checks. The `spawn` function receives the `_executableShell` variable, which is the `/bin/sh` command. This could result in any command, even if the function is written correctly, leading to `RCE`.
